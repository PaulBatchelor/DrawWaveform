#Draw-Waveform
##by Paul Batchelor

This is a small utility written in C that I made to draw waveforms of audio files
that were 2048 samples in length. 

Draw-Waveform requires the Cairo Graphics Library and libsndfile. 

To compile this program and the examples, run "make all" from the commandline.
